## Install the environment
make -f scripts/makefiles/01_software-environment.mk install_env

## See the list of targets for the other steps

```

### Analysis of the spike protein sequences

bla bla bla

The commands are specifie in the make file `make -f scripts/makefiles/03_protein-alignments.mk`. 

The list of targets can be obtained with the following command.

```
make -f make -f scripts/makefiles/03_protein-alignments.mk
